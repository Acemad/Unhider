# Unhider
A small script useful for making hidden vita (or any drive) folders visible without changing Windows settings.
(Originaly made for USB drives infected with that nasty shortcuts virus, since it hides your folders and files by adding a "system" attribute, this script removes both "system" and "hidden" attributes from all files in the drive)

## How to use (Windows)
First, you should connect your Vita to a PC using VitaShell 1.5+ !
Second, Simply open Unhider.bat and input the drive letter of the vita with colons (ex F:) and press enter. Done.
The same procedure can be used for any infected mass storage device.

## Warning
Although I didn't experience any issues with my vita after using this script, I'm not 100% sure if this method won't have any side effects, since it modifies file/folder attributes from a Windows based OS. Use at your own risk !

Thanks go to TheFlow for the amazing work !
